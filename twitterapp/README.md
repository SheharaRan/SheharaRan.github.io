This is my twitter bot that takes songs from the billboard top 100 and choses 4 of them. The songs are in an array and a random variable choses 4 random songs. It also makes sure that the 4 random songs aren't the same. It then tweets it out to create a short playlist that users can use to find new music.

you will need to...
  - have node.js downloaded
  - npm install twit
