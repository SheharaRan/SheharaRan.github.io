     <p class = "PhotoDescrip"> The concept for my personal branding was to design an identity that represents who I am: playful, bold, and fun. My personal branding would also set the tone for my design style which I portrayed through bright colors, decorative and sans-serif fonts, and bold graphics. The colors were inspired by the sunsets in my hometown:Â West Windsor, NJ.</p>
