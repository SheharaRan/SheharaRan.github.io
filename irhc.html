     <p class = "PhotoDescrip"> IRHC Stands for Inter-Residence Hall Council. Every Residence Hall has a hall council and IRHC is the overarching body for all the hall councils at NYU. They represent over 12,000 residents! Right now, I am the VP of Communications on IRHC therefore, I deal with all the marketing for our events as well as branding. So, I decided to re-bbrand IRHC to give it a fresh new take while still staying true to it's roots as well as create new elements such as a 2D Housie (IRHC's Mascot) and a re-designed website!! </p>
