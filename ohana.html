     <p class = "PhotoDescrip"> The Othmer Hall Council needed a shirt design to represent their hall council at different residential life events at NYU! I created this design by taking the hall's color, pink, and expanding on their tropical theme. I added the name of the hall to help promote their brand as well as raise visibility for the hall! </p>
