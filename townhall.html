     <p class = "PhotoDescrip">NYU's Inter-Residence Hall Council hosts a town hall every semester where residents get time to ask executives from all areas of the university questions about any of the concerns they have. My goal for the poster was to make town hall look more appealing for students to go to. I used the color purple because it is NYU's main color and I used different shades and tones to help give the poster a warm friendly vibe.</p>
