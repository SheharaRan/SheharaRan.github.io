     <p id = "TPhotoDescrip"> All University Games is NYU's intramural athletic competition between schools, administration and faculty teams. It's an evening of good-hearted competition, spirit, and violet pride! Every school has their own shirt that they wear at the games which help bring spirit and unity to the school. My goal for this design was to find a way to incorporate aspects of Tandon that really embody who we are as a school.</p>
